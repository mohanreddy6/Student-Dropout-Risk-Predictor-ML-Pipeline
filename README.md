# Student Dropout Risk Prediction

This project uses historical academic and demographic data to predict student dropout likelihood using machine learning models.

## Problem Statement

Educational institutions aim to identify students at risk of dropping out. This model helps retention teams intervene early.

## Methodology

1. Cleaned and merged datasets using Pandas
2. Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3. Created and validated:
   - Logistic Regression model
   - Random Forest classifier
4. Evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC
5. Deployed dashboards for leadership review

## Folder Structure

- `/data`: CSVs with student profiles (de-identified)
- `/notebooks`: Model training and evaluation
- `/tableau`: Retention dashboard screenshots
- `README.md`: Documentation and methodology

## Tools

- Python (Pandas, scikit-learn)
- SQL (PostgreSQL)
- Tableau, Jupyter Notebooks
